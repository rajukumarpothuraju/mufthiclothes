    <p>About Us
Mufti was launched in 1998 with one driving ambition - to provide Indian men with an alternative dressing solution, that didn‚Äôt conform to the ‚Äòuniform‚Äô codes of mainstream fashion. Mr Kamal Khushlani, our founder, mastered the art of manufacturing shirts in fabrics, colours and fit that sat at the intersection of international fashion and the Indian spirit. His vision was simple - build the first global fashion brand that is proudly Indian. Today, the Mufti portfolio includes everything from T-shirts and joggers to shorts and pants to sweaters and Jackets. Mufti‚Äôs bold and expressive style strives to provide our patrons with creative suave while being contemporary at heart.

Mufti has been synonymous with the world of denim jeans from the very beginning. With our patrons‚Äô comfort in mind, Mufti introduced the world to stretch jeans for men which was an instant hit and has now been adopted by brands across the globe. We firmly believe that jeans for men are not just a piece of clothing but a way of life. Whether you like them as skinny jeans or a more traditional cut in super slim fit jeans or modern jean joggers, Mufti has an exhaustive range in the most comfortable fabrics, textures and colours. Our flagship denim jeans range, Denim de Luxe Jeans, has been thoroughly vetted by our patrons over the decades and endured every test of time.
